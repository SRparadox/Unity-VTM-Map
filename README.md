# Unity-VTM-Map

# Concept
A 3d Map that takes in Open Street API to load the data from real world city maps and intigrates them to world of Vampire The Maquerade.
As of right now. The concept is that the game will load the location of a city (for the purposes of testing it will be santa cruz). The camera will be topdown view to see the entire city, with landmarks and buildings being small. As of now the main interaction is that the player will be able to select individual buildings and change which faction they belong to (for now the main way to show is to change the color of the buildings different colors). Whether they are Camarilla, Anarch, Hecata, Sabbat, Independent.
